Dude, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Peter Pan's Neverland Nightmare and honestly, what was that all about?! Like, are we all supposed to be scared of Peter now? That kid was straight-up terrifying, and not in a good way. I mean, I 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   thinking it would be a bit of a laugh, like a quirky twist, but wow, it really went to some dark places. 

First off, who knew Wendy could be so sassy? She’s like, “I’m not putting up with your creepy shadows today, Peter.” You kinda have to give her props, even though the whole dark Neverland vibe is a bummer. Seriously though, why does Pan have to be so angsty? It's like he's stuck in the teen phase forever, no pun intended. 

> And the Lost Boys, don't even get me started. They needed some serious therapy... or a nap. Like, can someone get them some snacks or something? Felt like Nobody was eating, just fighting shadows and mumbling about grown-ups. Sure, that’s the vibe of a nightmare, but come on, lighten up a bit!

Honestly, I kept waiting for Tinkerbell to save the day, but seems she was just busy throwing shade. You ever notice how much attitude she’s got? Anyway, the whole magical dust thing didn’t get used nearly enough. They missed an opportunity there to sprinkle some fun into it. Ugh, who am I kidding? It’s called a nightmare for a reason, right? 

But man, the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 ended, and I just sat there like, what do I even do now? And maybe it was just the angle they 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮ed it or the weird CGI, but I can’t take Peter seriously outside the Disney version anymore. The   just wasn’t what I thought when I decided to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , ya know?

print(Why is there Python code in here?)

Anyway, if you ever feel like spending a couple of hours in a really warped fairy tale, give it a shot. But like, maybe have something light-hearted on standby, like a palate cleanser. Maybe that's just me being dramatic, LOL. Let me know if you check it out.
